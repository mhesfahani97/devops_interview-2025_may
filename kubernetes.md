### 1. **What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is an open-source **container orchestration platform** designed to automate deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of hosts.

> 📌 You use Kubernetes when you need **automation**, **scalability**, **high availability**, and **self-healing** for containerized applications.

It shines in environments where:

* You need to run microservices at scale.
* You want to decouple workloads from infrastructure.
* You’re moving toward GitOps or declarative infrastructure.

However, Kubernetes isn’t always the best choice:

* Small workloads may be overkill.
* It introduces operational complexity.
* It requires a learning curve and infrastructure investment.

> **TL;DR**: Kubernetes is ideal when your system's **scale, complexity, or uptime** requirements justify its operational cost.

---

### 2. **What are the Core Components of Kubernetes?**

| Component                 | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `etcd`                    | A consistent and highly available **key-value store** for all cluster data.              |
| `kube-apiserver`          | The **entry point** for all API calls. Manages communication inside the cluster.         |
| `kube-scheduler`          | Decides **which node** a Pod should run on, based on resource requirements and policies. |
| `kube-controller-manager` | Manages **controllers** that regulate the cluster state (e.g., node, replication, job).  |
| `kubelet`                 | An agent that runs on each node to ensure containers are running in a Pod.               |
| `kube-proxy`              | Manages **network routing** for services on each node using iptables or IPVS.            |
| `Container Runtime`       | Executes and manages containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker – deprecated).          |

> All these components work together to provide a **resilient, self-healing, and declarative infrastructure** for containers.

---

### 3. **Is `kubelet` started on all nodes?**

Yes — **`kubelet` must run on every node** (including control plane nodes if they're also running workloads, but it is not best practice).

> 🧠 The `kubelet` is the **primary node agent** that connects each node to the Kubernetes control plane.

#### 🔧 Why is it required?

* It **registers the node** with the cluster via the API server.
* It **monitors Pod specs** assigned to that node.
* It ensures that containers are **running and healthy**.
* It **communicates with the container runtime** (e.g., containerd) to manage containers.

> If a node doesn’t have `kubelet` running, it **cannot join** the cluster or run workloads.

---

### 4. **Who checks the probes of the Pod?**

The **`kubelet`** is responsible for checking both **liveness** and **readiness probes** of Pods running on its node.

#### 🔍 Why `kubelet`?

Because:

* `kubelet` manages the **lifecycle** of all Pods on the node.
* It watches the PodSpec (via the API server) and performs health checks according to the probe configuration.
* It uses HTTP, TCP, or command execution to run the probe logic defined in the Pod YAML.

#### 🔄 What happens when a probe fails?

* **Liveness probe fails**: `kubelet` kills the container → it will be restarted by the controller (e.g., Deployment).
* **Readiness probe fails**: `kubelet` marks the Pod as **not ready** → it is removed from Service load balancing.

---

### 5. **What is the Kubernetes Control Plane?**

The **control plane** is the **brain** of the Kubernetes cluster.

| Component                               | What It Does                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kube-apiserver`                        | The **front door**. All communication goes through here.                |
| `etcd`                                  | The **database** that stores everything (cluster state).                |
| `kube-scheduler`                        | Decides **which node** will run a new Pod.                              |
| `controller-manager`                    | Keeps the cluster in the **desired state** (e.g., scaling, restarting). |
| (Optionally) `cloud-controller-manager` | Talks to the cloud provider (e.g., creates load balancers).             |

> All of these run on **control plane nodes** (also called **master nodes**).

---

Great intuition again — you're right that the `kube-apiserver` is the central communication point. Let’s rephrase and expand your answer into a clear and professional response, suitable for a senior DevOps interview:

---

### 6. **How does the `kubelet` communicate with the controller?**

The **`kubelet` communicates with the Kubernetes control plane via the `kube-apiserver`** — the central and only access point to all cluster state and controller logic.

#### 🔗 Communication Flow:

* `kubelet` watches the **Pod specifications** assigned to its node via the `kube-apiserver`.
* It **reports node status**, **Pod status**, and **probe results** back to the API server.
* It doesn’t talk **directly** to the scheduler or controllers — **only through the API server**.

---

### 🧠 Why do we say "controller"?

In Kubernetes, **controllers** are control loops that **watch resources** via the API server and **reconcile** the actual state with the desired state.

#### 🤖 Common controllers (running inside `kube-controller-manager`):

* **ReplicaSet Controller**: Ensures correct number of Pod replicas.
* **Node Controller**: Monitors node health.
* **Job Controller**: Handles completion of batch jobs.
* **Deployment Controller**: Manages rollouts and updates.

So when we say "controller," we refer to any of these logic components that act upon the state reported to the `kube-apiserver`.

---

### 7. **How Does Kubernetes Process a Request?**

📥 Step-by-Step:

1. **Client Sends Request**

   * Could be an API call, HTTP request, etc.

2. **Ingress Point (depends on Service type)**

   * **`LoadBalancer`**: If exposed via a cloud LB, traffic hits the external LB → forwarded to a Node.
   * **`Ingress`**: For HTTP/S traffic, goes through an Ingress Controller (like NGINX, Traefik).
   * **`NodePort`**: Accesses a high port on any node → forwarded internally.
   * **`ExternalName`**: Simply resolves to an external DNS name (no traffic routing in cluster).

3. **kube-proxy (on the target node)**

   * Receives traffic for the **ClusterIP** of the Service.
   * Uses **iptables**, **IPVS**, or **eBPF** to route traffic to a healthy backend Pod.

4. **ClusterIP Service**

   * The virtual IP assigned to the Service.
   * kube-proxy balances traffic across one of the selected Pods.

5. **Pod**

   * Finally, the request reaches the container inside a Pod via the `targetPort`.

---

### 8. **How Does Kubernetes Handle Authentication and Authorization?**

Kubernetes separates **auth** into two key phases:

---

## 🔐 1. **Authentication (Who are you?)**

Kubernetes first checks *who* is making the request. It supports several **authentication methods**, such as:

| Method             | Example Use Case                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| TLS Client Certs   | Admin users / kubelets                     |
| Bearer Tokens      | Service accounts / static tokens           |
| OIDC               | Login via Google, Azure AD, Keycloak, etc. |
| Webhook Token Auth | Custom external auth service               |
| Anonymous Access   | Disabled by default (for security reasons) |

The **`kube-apiserver`** performs this check.

---

## ✅ 2. **Authorization (Are you allowed to do this?)**

Once the user is authenticated, Kubernetes checks whether they’re **authorized** to perform the requested action.

This is handled using:

### 🔑 **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

RBAC uses:

* **Roles / ClusterRoles**: Define permissions (verbs like get, list, delete on resources).
* **RoleBindings / ClusterRoleBindings**: Attach those roles to users or service accounts.

---

## 📍 Optional: Admission Control

After passing authentication and authorization, **admission controllers** can perform **validations, mutations, or policy enforcement** (e.g., deny creating a privileged Pod).

---

### 9. **How Does Communication Happen in Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes networking enables **Pod-to-Pod**, **Pod-to-Service**, and **intra-/inter-node** communication through a combination of:

---

## 🔧 Key Components of K8s Networking

| Component           | Role in Communication                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CNI Plugin**      | Manages Pod IPs and Pod-to-Pod communication           |
| **kube-proxy**      | Routes Service traffic to Pods using ClusterIP         |
| **ClusterIP**       | Virtual IP for Services that routes traffic internally |
| **Node networking** | Ensures traffic can move between nodes                 |

---

### 📡 1. **Pod-to-Pod Communication (CNI)**

* Kubernetes expects **all Pods to have unique IPs** in a flat network.
* This is handled by the **CNI (Container Network Interface)** plugin.

  * Examples: Calico, Flannel, Cilium, Weave.
* The CNI ensures that:

  * Every Pod gets a routable IP.
  * Any Pod can talk to any other Pod — on the **same or different nodes**.

> ✅ No NAT is required for Pod-to-Pod traffic (in ideal CNI setups).

---

### 🔀 2. **Pod-to-Service Communication (kube-proxy + ClusterIP)**

* Services (like `ClusterIP`) use **virtual IPs**.
* `kube-proxy` intercepts traffic to that IP and routes it to a healthy backend Pod using:

  * `iptables`
  * `IPVS`
  * `eBPF` (in advanced setups like Cilium)

> 📌 The request is load-balanced across Pods selected by the Service’s label selector.

---

### 🌐 3. **Cross-Node Communication**

* When Pods on different nodes talk, the traffic flows over the node's network.
* The CNI must support **inter-node routing**.
* kube-proxy ensures the request lands on the correct node and Pod.

---

## 10. **How Does the Kubernetes Network Work?**

---

## 🧱 Key Design Principles

Kubernetes has **two fundamental assumptions** about networking:

1. **Every Pod gets its own unique IP address.**
2. **All Pods can communicate with each other, without NAT.**

> This is very different from traditional networking, where multiple containers share one IP and use port mapping.

---

## 📦 Networking Layers in Kubernetes

Let’s break it into the main components that make it work:

---

### 1. 🧩 **Container Network Interface (CNI)**

> The **CNI plugin** is responsible for assigning IP addresses to Pods and configuring network routes.

* When a Pod is created, Kubernetes calls the CNI to:

  * Assign a **unique IP** to the Pod
  * Set up **virtual networking** (bridge, veth pair)
  * Configure routing tables and interfaces
* Examples: **Calico**, **Flannel**, **Cilium**, **Weave**

📌 **CNI enables Pod-to-Pod communication**, even across nodes.

---

### 2. 🔄 **Service Networking (ClusterIP + kube-proxy)**

Kubernetes Services provide a **stable virtual IP** (ClusterIP) to access a group of Pods.

* `kube-proxy` runs on every node and handles traffic to ClusterIP Services.
* It uses:

  * `iptables` (rules in kernel)
  * `IPVS` (IP Virtual Server in kernel)
  * `eBPF` (modern method in Cilium)

📌 kube-proxy ensures **load balancing** and **routing** from Service IP → healthy Pod IPs.

---

### 3. 🚪 **Node Networking (Inter-node Traffic)**

* If Pods on different nodes need to talk, traffic goes over the **underlying node network**.
* The **CNI must handle inter-node routing**.

  * Example: Calico uses BGP to advertise Pod routes.
* Without this, Pods on different nodes wouldn’t be able to reach each other.

---

### 4. 🌍 **External Communication (Egress/Ingress)**

* **Ingress**: HTTP(S) traffic from outside → exposed using **Ingress controllers** (NGINX, Traefik).
* **NodePort / LoadBalancer**: Allow external access to Services.
* **Egress**: Pods accessing the internet.

  * Usually NATed via the **node’s IP**.
  * Some CNI plugins (e.g., Calico) can control egress traffic too.

---

## 🔁 Common Traffic Flows

| Scenario                   | Flow                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Pod → Pod (same node)      | CNI routes traffic directly                          |
| Pod → Pod (different node) | CNI + underlying node network                        |
| Pod → Service              | kube-proxy routes to a Pod via ClusterIP             |
| External → Service         | LoadBalancer / NodePort / Ingress → kube-proxy → Pod |
| Pod → Internet             | Pod IP SNAT’d to Node IP → internet                  |

---

### 12. **When NAT Happens in Kubernetes**

NAT occurs in several scenarios within a Kubernetes cluster, mainly involving **communication across different network boundaries**. Here are the key scenarios:

---

#### 1. **Pod-to-External Traffic (Egress to Internet)**

* **When**: A Pod accesses an external service (e.g., API, website).
* **Where**: The traffic goes through the **Node’s IP** or a **NAT gateway** (e.g., in AWS, the EKS worker node or NAT Gateway in a private subnet).
* **NAT Type**: **Source NAT (SNAT)**.
* **Why**: The Pod’s IP is not routable on the internet, so it's translated to the Node’s public IP.

---

#### 2. **External-to-Service (Ingress via NodePort/LoadBalancer)**

* **When**: An external client accesses a Service via a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.
* **Where**: The request lands on the node and is forwarded to a backend Pod.
* **NAT Type**: **Destination NAT (DNAT)** for load balancing and port mapping.
* **Note**: This also causes **Source NAT (SNAT)** on return traffic, which can mask the original client IP unless special care is taken.

---

#### 3. **Inter-namespace Pod-to-Service Traffic**

* **When**: A Pod accesses a Service (ClusterIP) in another namespace.
* **NAT Type**: Typically **no NAT** if using a flat network (like Calico, Cilium).
* **But**: If kube-proxy is in iptables mode and hairpin routing is needed (Pod accesses its own service), **SNAT** might happen to ensure proper routing.

---

#### 4. **Hairpin NAT (Pod Accessing Its Own Service)**

* **When**: A Pod accesses a Service that points back to itself.
* **Why**: Kubernetes may need to SNAT to make the return path work, depending on the CNI and kube-proxy mode.
* **Enabled by**: Setting `hairpinMode=promiscuous-bridge` or `veth` in kubelet.

---

#### 5. **Service-to-Pod Traffic (ClusterIP Service)**

* **When**: One Pod accesses another Pod via a ClusterIP Service.
* **Usually**: **No NAT** if kube-proxy is configured properly and your CNI supports direct routing.
* **But**: **SNAT may occur** if traffic crosses nodes, depending on the CNI (e.g., in kube-proxy iptables mode with default config).

---

#### 6. **HostNetwork Pod Accessing ClusterIP**

* **When**: A Pod with `hostNetwork: true` accesses a ClusterIP.
* **SNAT** may happen to avoid routing issues since it originates from the host network namespace.

---

#### 7. **CNI-Plugin Dependent Behavior**

Each CNI (Calico, Flannel, Cilium, etc.) may implement NAT differently. For example:

* **Calico with BGP**: Can do **no NAT** with proper routing.
* **Flannel**: Often does **SNAT** for cross-node traffic.
* **Cilium**: Can do NAT-less routing with eBPF, depending on mode.

---

### 13. **How Does a Service Work?**

#### ⚙️ Behind the Scenes (Flow)

1. **Endpoints Created:**

   * Kubernetes creates an `Endpoints` object listing the Pod IPs selected by the Service.

2. **Virtual IP (ClusterIP):**

   * Kubernetes allocates a **virtual IP** (VIP) from the internal service CIDR range.
   * This IP is stable even as Pods come and go.

3. **kube-proxy Programming:**

   * `kube-proxy` (running on each node) sets up iptables or IPVS (or eBPF in newer setups like Cilium).
   * It maps the VIP to a set of backend Pod IPs.
   * Traffic to the Service IP is **load balanced** to one of the Pods.

4. **Routing Logic:**

   * When a client connects to `my-service:80`, kube-proxy rewrites the destination to a real Pod IP\:Port.

---

### 14. **Design Goals Behind Kubernetes Service Implementation**

#### 1. **Decouple Clients from Pod Lifecycles**

#### ✅ Goal:

Pods are **ephemeral** — they can die, restart, or be replaced.

#### 🧠 Why SVC Helps:

Services provide a **stable virtual IP and DNS name**, so clients don’t need to track ever-changing Pod IPs.

#### 🔍 Alternative Considered:

* Clients track Pod IPs directly (complex, brittle).
* Use an external service discovery tool (heavyweight).

---

#### 2. **Built-in Load Balancing**

#### ✅ Goal:

Even traffic distribution across all healthy Pods.

#### 🧠 Why SVC Helps:

`kube-proxy` transparently balances traffic across matching endpoints (Pods), either with iptables, IPVS, or eBPF.

#### 🔍 Alternative Considered:

* Apps do their own load balancing (leads to duplicated, error-prone logic).
* Sidecar proxies per Pod (higher complexity, heavier infra — now sometimes used with service meshes like Istio).

---

#### 3. **Simplicity & Portability**

#### ✅ Goal:

Keep things **simple and portable** across environments (bare metal, VMs, cloud).

#### 🧠 Why SVC Helps:

* Abstracts away environment-specific networking.
* Works with a simple DNS + IP + kube-proxy design.
* No reliance on cloud-specific load balancers (though optional `LoadBalancer` type leverages them).

---

#### 4. **Native Service Discovery**

#### ✅ Goal:

Enable **service discovery** without external tools.

#### 🧠 Why SVC Helps:

DNS-based service discovery (`my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`) is simple, portable, and avoids needing custom clients or SDKs.

---

#### 5. **Compatibility with Unix Networking Model**

#### ✅ Goal:

Leverage proven Linux networking primitives.

#### 🧠 Why SVC Helps:

Using **iptables/IPVS** is efficient and well-supported. Services are implemented as kernel-level rules → no need for a full-fledged proxy layer per app.

---

#### 6. **Support for Multiple Service Types**

#### ✅ Goal:

Support internal and external traffic with minimal config changes.

---

###  15. **How CoreDNS Works in Kubernetes**

#### 1. **Deployment as a Kubernetes Addon**

CoreDNS runs as a **Deployment** in the `kube-system` namespace with a Service called `kube-dns`.

This `kube-dns` Service has a **stable ClusterIP**, like `10.96.0.10`, which is configured as the **DNS server** in every Pod's `/etc/resolv.conf`.

---

#### 2. **Pod DNS Lookup Flow**

When a Pod does:

```bash
curl my-service
```

Here’s what happens:

```
[Pod] → /etc/resolv.conf points to CoreDNS IP →
    CoreDNS receives DNS request →
    Parses request: e.g. my-service.default.svc.cluster.local →
    Talks to kube-apiserver (via Kubernetes plugin) →
    Resolves to ClusterIP of the Service →
    Returns DNS response to Pod
```

---

### 16. **Define a scenario where scaling coredns makes response latency higher than before**

> **You increase CoreDNS replicas from 2 to 5 to improve availability, but DNS lookups from Pods become slower — sometimes even failing intermittently.**

---

#### 1. **kube-proxy Round-Robin Load Balancing + TCP Retries**

* **CoreDNS runs as a `ClusterIP` service**.
* kube-proxy **round-robins** traffic to **all CoreDNS Pods**.
* If a new replica **isn't ready yet**, has high CPU load, or is not on a healthy node → queries routed there can timeout or retry.
* DNS clients often use **UDP**, which has no retransmission logic at the protocol level, so **kubelet or libc retry with TCP**, causing latency spikes.

📉 **Effect**:

* DNS lookups can take **hundreds of ms** longer than before.
* Retries cause **jitter** in application startup times.

---

### 2. **Node-local DNS Cache Not Aware of New Pods**

* In many optimized setups, `node-local-dns` runs on each node and forwards to CoreDNS.
* If CoreDNS replicas are added **without updating `node-local-dns` config or readiness**, some nodes may:

  * Forward to a non-existent or unready CoreDNS Pod
  * Or suffer from TCP retries due to IPVS sync delay

📉 **Effect**:

* Node-local cache tries to query new CoreDNS Pods that aren’t ready, increasing lookup time.

---

### 3. **Pod-to-CoreDNS Network Path Becomes Suboptimal**

* When CoreDNS runs on more nodes, **cross-node traffic** increases.
* If the Service IP is routed to a remote node (e.g., due to IPVS or iptables configuration), DNS requests cross nodes instead of hitting a local CoreDNS Pod.

📉 **Effect**:

* Increased latency due to cross-node hops (especially under CNI plugins with no local Pod affinity).

---

### 4. **Cache Fragmentation**

* More replicas mean **smaller effective DNS cache** per instance.
* If CoreDNS uses the `cache` plugin with 30s TTL, each replica has its own cache.
* With 5 replicas, cache hit rate drops vs. 2 replicas — **more frequent upstream lookups** (e.g., to Google DNS).

📉 **Effect**:

* Lower cache hit ratio → higher average DNS latency.

---

### 5. **Increased Load on API Server**

* The `kubernetes` plugin in CoreDNS queries the kube-apiserver.
* More CoreDNS replicas = more watchers and API requests.
* On large clusters, this can put stress on the kube-apiserver → slows down response to CoreDNS → slows down DNS replies.

📉 **Effect**:

* Latency added due to API server throttling or resource pressure.

---

### 17. **What are core DNS plugins, and how can we use them?**

---

## 🔧 Common CoreDNS Plugins (Used in Kubernetes)

| Plugin                   | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kubernetes`             | Resolves names of Services and Pods from the Kubernetes API  |
| `forward`                | Forwards DNS queries to an upstream resolver (e.g., 8.8.8.8) |
| `cache`                  | Caches DNS responses to speed up future lookups              |
| `loop`                   | Detects DNS loop issues (useful for stability)               |
| `reload`                 | Automatically reloads CoreDNS if the config changes          |
| `health`                 | Exposes a health check endpoint (HTTP)                       |
| `metrics` / `prometheus` | Exposes DNS metrics (for Prometheus scraping)                |
| `log` / `errors`         | Logs DNS queries and errors (useful for debugging)           |
| `hosts`                  | Allows static host-to-IP mappings, like `/etc/hosts`         |
| `template`               | Dynamically builds DNS records from templates (advanced use) |

### 18. **Is coredns resolving pods? If not, how can we add it?**
Yes, it can—but only if the *pods* option in the `kubernetes` plugin is enabled.

### 19. **If CoreDNS doesn’t resolve generic Pods — how does a StatefulSet provide stable Pod names?**
statefulset uses headless, A headless service lets you connect to each Pod directly, by name, without load balancing.

### 20. **How does CoreDNS resolve external addresses**
CoreDNS resolves external domains by forwarding the request to upstream DNS servers using the forward plugin.

### 21. **How do Pods know the IP address of the CoreDNS service?** 
Pods know the CoreDNS IP because Kubernetes automatically puts it in /etc/resolv.conf when the Pod starts.
